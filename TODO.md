# TODO

- Bug

1. can't do vertical line position automation
2. can't repaint multiband when it is disabled in DAWs like Ableton or Fl Studio
3. can't show preset name in preset box when it is loaded. The solution is when you change slider value you should set presetId to 0.
4. open menu and close host will cause LookAndFeel error
5. can't set drive value when switching A/B mode

- Feature

1. add enable button for compressor, downsample, width, filter, etc.
2. auto-update check when open
3. add graph for filters
4. add mid-side / width / pan knobs
5. add solo button between vertical lines
6. width graph
7. mouse drag vertically to change the output volume, like Ozone or saturn2
8. smooth spectrogram
9. put all knobs into a menu like serum fx
10. add lfo control
11. change A/B color when switching
12. add max input/output value for meters (currently RMS)

- Improvement

1. improve code quality about the vertical lines part
2. reduce paint CPU usage
