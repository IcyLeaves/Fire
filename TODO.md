# TODO

- Bug

1. can't do vertical line position automation
2. can't repaint multiband when it is disabled in DAWs like Ableton or Fl Studio
3. can't show preset name in preset box when it is loaded. The solution is when you change slider value you should set presetId to 0.
4. spectrogram flash
5. just open plugin and doesn't change anything, when you close Ableton, it will pop up whether save or not option
6. open menu and close host will cause LookAndFeel error
7. drive knob GUI flashes when playing dynamic range audios such as guitar loops.

- Feature

1. add enable button for compressor, downsample, width, filter, etc.
2. add own volume meter, remove ff meters
3. auto-update check when open
4. add graph for filters
5. add mid-side / width / pan knobs
6. add solo button between vertical lines
7. width graph
8. mouse drag vertically to change the output volume, like Ozone or saturn2
9. smooth spectrogram
10. put all knobs into a menu like serum fx
11. add lfo control

- Improvement

1. improve code quality about the vertical lines part
2. reduce paint CPU usage
