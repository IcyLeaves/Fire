# TODO

- Bug

1. can't repaint multiband when it is disabled in DAWs like Ableton or Fl Studio
2. can't show preset name in preset box when it is loaded. The solution is when you change slider value you should set presetId to 0.
3. open menu and close host will cause LookAndFeel error
4. can't set drive value when switching A/B mode
5. drive knob flash bug

- Feature

1. add enable button for compressor, downsample, width, filter, etc.
2. auto-update check when open
3. add graph for filters
4. add mid-side / pan knobs
5. add solo button between vertical lines
6. mouse drag vertically to change the output volume, like Ozone or saturn2
7. smooth spectrogram
8. put all knobs into a menu like serum fx
9. add lfo control
10. change A/B color when switching
11. add max input/output value for meters (currently RMS)

- Improvement

1. reduce paint CPU usage
