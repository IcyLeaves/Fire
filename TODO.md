TODO
1. reduce CPU usage of oversampling
2. oversampling may sound different when using filter.
3. smooth filter?
4. adjust the position of ff meters
5. add left and right preset selection button
6. save preset mode and A/B mode into processor.cpp
(maybe need to delete preset.cpp and only use preset.h)
