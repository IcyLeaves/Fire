# TODO

1. reduce CPU usage (future plan)
2. adjust the position of ff meters
3. save the xml of AB mode in processor.cpp get/set state function
4. maybe add auto-update function?
5. click one band area will change drive knob value (create 3 new knobs to control different parameters)
6. click one band area one fill color
7. add graph for filters
8. maybe improve code quality about the vertical lines part (for example use Vector)
9. updateLines function should be called only when mouse clicking (but when clicking closebutton, the editor won't detect a mouse event)
10. save x positions of vertical lines and implement that on muti-band distortion
11. add mid-side / width / pan knobs
12. add solo/enable button between vertical lines
